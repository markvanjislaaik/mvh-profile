    "AboutMe": [
        "As a self-taught programmer with over 6 years of professional experience, I got my start in the industry by automating basic file operations for a television production company.",
        "Since then, as a passionate tinkerer with a positive \"can-do\" attitude, I've worked on a variety of projects including audio fingerprinting and detection for radio and TV stations, image recognition for finding logos and patterns on live TV to most recently identifying and fulfilling a critical business need within our organization to develop and maintain our own file upload portal. This allowed the business to cut costs dramatically for the submission of Radio & TV adverts to local broadcasters.",
        "My expertise lies in working with Python, MySQL and building REST APIs using Flask and Django. I am a fast learning and modest self-starter who is eager to get involved with various technologies that will enable me to contribute to other areas such as DevOps, Frontend Development, Data Science and Full Stack.",
        "I am a team player and enjoy mentoring my junior colleagues, helping them find their strengths and motivating them to take charge of their own skills development. I'm also a hard worker, easy going and a nice guy to have around.",
        "With a well-rounded knowledge and experience in IT and programming workflows, I am confident that I can bring invaluable growth to any team and make a significant contribution to the company's success.",
        "I am looking for an intermediate backend software development role at a small to medium-sized company with experienced and supportive professionals from diverse backgrounds."
