    "Overview": "A passionate tinkerer with a positive \"can-do\" attitude.",
    "AboutMe": [
        "I am looking for an intermediate backend software development role at a small to medium-sized company with experienced and supportive professionals from diverse backgrounds.",
        "My expertise lies in working with Python, MySQL and building REST APIs using Flask and Django. I am a fast learning and modest self-starter who is eager to get involved with various technologies that will enable me to contribute to other areas such as DevOps, Frontend Development, Data Science and Full Stack.",
        "As a self-taught programmer with over 6 years of professional experience, I got my start in the industry by automating basic file operations for a television production company.",
        "Since then, as a passionate tinkerer with a positive \"can-do\" attitude, I've worked on a variety of projects including audio fingerprinting and detection for radio and TV stations, image recognition for finding logos and patterns on live TV to most recently identifying and fulfilling a critical business need within our organization to develop and maintain our own file upload portal. This allowed the business to cut costs dramatically for the submission of Radio & TV adverts to local broadcasters.",
        "I am a team player and enjoy mentoring my junior colleagues, helping them find their strengths and motivating them to take charge of their own skills development. I'm also a hard worker, easy going and a nice guy to have around.",
        "With a well-rounded knowledge and experience of IT and programming workflows, I am confident that I can bring invaluable growth to any team and make a significant contribution to the company's success."
