# CV Profile Page

## A Simple Static Web page that Hosts my CV.

This app was inspired by a Job Posting for which applicants are asked to: "Create a Google App Engine Python Project with your CV as the main page. Check-in the code to Github and send us a link".

This is actually a great exercise for anyone looking to work in the software world.

I chose to use the Flask framework with which I'm used to spinning up sites and API's quickly with little to no configuration.
